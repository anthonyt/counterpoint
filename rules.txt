First Species:
	1 voice counterpoint

	Necessary:
		Counterpoint moves with same rhythm as cantus-firmus (note for note)

		parallel motion verboten:
			unless interval is (3rd or 6th or 10th)
			AND there are no more than 3 consecutive statements of one interval

		parallel perfect intervals (1, 5, 8, 12) are always verboten
			(subset of previous rule, but we usually call it something else)

		high point of melodic curve should not coincide.

		no voice crossing wrt current note (voice crossing)
		no voice crossing wrt previous note (overlapping)

		only permissable horizontal motions:
			m2, M2, m3, M3, P4, P5, m6, M6, P8

		only permissable vertical intervals:
			m3, M3, P4, P5, m6, M6, P8, m10, M10, P11, P12
			EXCEPT: P1 is permissable on first and last notes.

		pairs of (local min, local max) and (local max, local min) must have
			intervallic relationship that fits in permissible vertical intervals
			'indirect horizontal dissonance'

		don't immediately repeat a note
			EXCEPT: you can actually do this once. it's supposed to be tied.

		don't immediately repeat a melodic segment (or a transposition thereof)

		immediately after a leap of (P5, m6, M6, P8), must move by step (m2, M2)
			in opposite direction

		do not leave vocal range.

		direct motion - do not move to P5 or P8 with similar motion
			ie with both voices moving down, or both voices moving up

		lower voice must start with tonic

		upper voice must start with tonic or 5th

		upper voice must end with the "degree 7, degree 8" pattern.

		if in a minor key, upper voice must end with "#7, 8"

		may not use notes that are outside of the key
			EXCEPT: degree 7 at end of upper voice in minor key
			        degree 6 in minor key if not doing so would result in horizontal interval of aug2

		may not play #6 along side natural 6 or #7 against natural 7

		

	Desirable:
		contrary motion
		step when cantus firmus leaps
		leap when cantus firmus steps
		don't often exceed interval of a 10th
		use more steps (m2, M2) than leaps
		change direction frequently
		build up to a high point, then come back down
		avoid hovering within a small span (like a 3rd or 4th)
		use more (m3, M3, m6, M6) than (P5, P8)
